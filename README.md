Instructions and issue tracker for WMT19 reference-based DA campaigns

## TL;DR

- Find the login page here: https://wmt19.waypost.net/
- WMT19 will feature reference-based direct assessment (DA), carried out by research teams
- This evaluation will be based on segment-level annotation
- Language pairs we are currently running are: DE-CS, DE-FR, CS-DE, ZH-EN
- To participate, **you need to be proficient in one of the target languages only**
- Please use the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/bricksdont/WMT19RefDA/issues) to report any problems

## Timeline

- 5/10--5/15: research teams request accounts
- 5/15: instructions online on Github
- 5/15: notification sent out to teams, annotation starts
- 5/27: annotation ends

## Campaign overview

### How will the annotation work?

Annotations will be collected in Turkle, implementing segment-level,
reference-based direct assessment. For every language pair, there will be a
pre-generated amount of annotations tasks ("HITs").

We also generate
anonymised accounts which are pre-assigned to exactly two annotation tasks.
Based on previous WMT evaluation campaigns, the average annotation time for
two tasks is one hour. So, every annotation account maps to one hour of work.

### How much annotation work is needed?

Each research team is expected to contribute **eight hours of annotation work
per primary system** submission. Based on previous WMT evaluation campaigns, the average annotation time for one task is 30 minutes. One task involves approximately 100 judgements.

### Who can be an annotator?

The reference-based evaluation campaign is curently run for the following target languages: CS, FR, DE, EN. **To participate in this evaluation, you need to be proficient in one of those languages.**

### How are accounts distributed?

We kindly ask you to sign up in this Google form: https://forms.gle/tcNiaiJpoyqi2hZ79, with your preferred user name. We will create this account on Turkle for you, and reach out to you by email to confirm.

### How can I sign into Turkle?

For each account, we provide a **single sign-on (SSO) URL**. This allows you
to sign into Appraise with a single click on the URL, making access very easy.

### How does reference-based DA work?

You are shown two sentences at a time, both in the same language. Your task is to judge whether the second sentence has the same meaning as the first.

### How can I report problems?

Please use the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/bricksdont/WMT19RefDA/issues)
to report any problems. For urgent problems you can also contact
